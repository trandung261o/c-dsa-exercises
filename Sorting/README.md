##### Exercise 1: 
    Write a program that takes three positive integers n, m, and M as input. 
    Generate n positive integers, a1, a2, ..., an, randomly within the range from m to M. 
    Save the data to a file named arr-n.txt with the following format:
    -Line 1: Write the positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 106).
    -Line 2: Write a1, a2, ..., an. Separate the numbers by a space.

##### Exercise 2:  Sorting a Sequence of Positive Integers using Selection Sort 
    Write a program to input a sequence of positive integers a1, a2, …, an 
    and sort this sequence in non-decreasing order using the selection sort algorithm.
    Input (stdin)
    -Line 1: A positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6)
    -Line 2: Positive integers a1, a2, …, an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^6)
    4
    5 4 3 4 1 2
    Output (stdout)
    Print the sequence sorted in non-decreasing order, with elements separated by a space.
    1 2 3 4 4 5
