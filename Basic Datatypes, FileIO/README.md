##### Exercise 1: Display the array in reverse order
##### Exercise 2: Find the Special Element in the Array
    Extend the above example program to display the array element 
    that is closest to the average value of all array elements.
##### Exercise 3:
    Write a program that takes an input string and displays the number of occurrences of each character in the string. 
    The output should be displayed for the input string "hello, world!":
    The letter 'd' appears 1 time(s).
    The letter 'e' appears 1 time(s).
    The letter 'h' appears 1 time(s).
    The letter 'l' appears 3 time(s).
    The letter 'o' appears 2 time(s).
    The letter 'r' appears 1 time(s).
    The letter 'w' appears 1 time(s).
##### Exercise 4:
    Write a function that takes two integer arrays as arguments, both having the same number of elements. 
    The function returns 1 if the two arrays have identical content and 0 for all other cases.
##### Exercise 5:
    Write a function:
    - With parameters as a string and two characters.
    - The function will traverse the string and replace all occurrences 
    of the first character in the string with the second character.
    Write a program to test the above function:
    - Read a string that does not contain whitespace and two characters, 
    then call the function with the specified arguments and print the result.
    Example:
    - Input: "papa", 'p', 'm'
    - Result: "mama"
##### Exercise 6: Word Separation
    Write a program that reads a character string representing a sentence from the user. 
    Then the program displays each word in the sentence on a separate line. 
    A word is a sequence of consecutive characters that does not contain whitespace.
    Example:
    ▪ Input: "The house next door is very old."
    ▪ Result:
    The
    house
    ….
