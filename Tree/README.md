##### Exercise 1: 
    -Traverse the tree using three algorithms: Preorder traversal, Inorder traversal, Postorder traversal.
    -Write a function to free the memory of a tree: freeTree(TreeNode *r)
    -Write a function to count the total number of nodes in the tree: countNode(Treenode *r)
    -Write a function to count the total number of leafs in the tree: countLeaf(Treenode *r)
    -Write a function to count the total number of nodes with k child in the tree: countNodeWithKchild(Treenode *r)

##### Exercise 2: (Binary tree)
    -Traverse the binary tree using three algorithms: Preorder traversal, Inorder traversal, Postorder traversal.
    -Write a function to free the memory of a binary tree: freeTree(TreeNode *r)
    -Write a function to count the total number of nodes in the binary tree: countNode(Treenode *r)
    -Write a function to count the total number of internal nodes in the binary tree: countInternalNode(Treenode *r)
    -Write a function to count the total number of nodes with k child in the binary tree: countNodeWithKchild(Treenode *r)

##### Exercise 3: (Binary tree)
    Write a C program to run interactively with the following commands:
    -Load <filename>: Load data from file <filename> and construct the tree
    -Print: Print the tree to the screen
    -AddLeftChild <cur_id> <child_id>: Add the left child <child_id> (if not
    already existent) to the node with identifier <cur_id> if <cur_id> exists
    -AddRightChild <cur_id> <child_id>: Add the right child <child_id> (if not
    already existent) to the node with identifier <cur_id> if <cur_id> exists
    -Find <id>: Find the node with identifier <id>
    -Count: Count the number of nodes in the tree
    -FindLeaves: Print to the screen the leaf nodes of the tree
    -Height <id>: Print to the screen the height of the node <id> (if it exists)
    -Store <filename>: Save the tree data to file <filename>
    -Quit: Exit the program
