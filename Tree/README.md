##### Exercise 1: 
    -Traverse the tree using three algorithms: Preorder traversal, Inorder traversal, Postorder traversal.
    -Write a function to free the memory of a tree: freeTree(TreeNode *r)
    -Write a function to count the total number of nodes in the tree: countNode(Treenode *r)
    -Write a function to count the total number of leafs in the tree: countLeaf(Treenode *r)
    -Write a function to count the total number of nodes with k child in the tree: countNodeWithKchild(Treenode *r)

##### Exercise 2: (Binary tree)
    -Traverse the binary tree using three algorithms: Preorder traversal, Inorder traversal, Postorder traversal.
    -Write a function to free the memory of a binary tree: freeTree(TreeNode *r)
    -Write a function to count the total number of nodes in the binary tree: countNode(Treenode *r)
    -Write a function to count the total number of internal nodes in the binary tree: countInternalNode(Treenode *r)
    -Write a function to count the total number of nodes with k child in the binary tree: countNodeWithKchild(Treenode *r)
